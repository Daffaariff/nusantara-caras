{
    "diagnosis": "Pulpitis or dental abscess",
    "hypothesis": "The patient is likely experiencing pulpitis, which is inflammation of the dental pulp, possibly due to caries or irritation, leading to intermittent pain exacerbated by cold stimuli and relieved by warmth. This could also indicate a dental abscess if there is an associated infection.",
    "history_and_examination_findings": "The patient presents with a toothache that started 3 days ago, localized to the back teeth, characterized as a pressing, pulsating sensation. The pain is intermittent, lasting from minutes to hours, worsens in the morning, and is aggravated by cold water while alleviated by warm water. Severity is rated as 6 on a pain scale.",
    "investigation_plan": "A dental examination is necessary, including visual inspection for caries, percussion testing for sensitivity, and possibly radiographs to assess for abscess formation or pulp involvement.",
    "management_plan": "If diagnosed with pulpitis, options include restorative treatment such as fillings or possibly root canal therapy. If an abscess is present, appropriate antibiotics and drainage may be required.",
    "prognosis": "With timely dental intervention, the prognosis is generally good. However, untreated pulpitis can progress to more severe complications, including tooth loss.",
    "doctors_prescription": "Prescription for analgesics (e.g., ibuprofen) for pain management and, if an abscess is identified, antibiotics such as amoxicillin or clindamycin depending on patient allergy history.",
    "summary": "A patient presents with a 3-day history of intermittent toothache localized to the back teeth, characterized by a pulsating sensation, worsened by cold and improved by warm stimuli. The clinical suspicion includes pulpitis or possibly a dental abscess."
